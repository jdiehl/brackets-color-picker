# Brackets Color Picker

**The Brackets Color Picker has been discontinued. Please use the built-in color picker.**

Edit hex colors with a color picker.

## Install

Clone the extension manager into the disabled extensions folder from Brackets:

    git clone git://github.com/jdiehl/brackets-color-picker.git brackets/src/extensions/disabled/color-picker

Create a link to enable the extension manager:

    ln -s brackets/src/extensions/disabled/color-picker brackets/src/extensions/user/color-picker

## Run

Press CMD-E with the cursor on a hex color code (#ffaaaa).
Note, that you must drag the mouse cursor to change colors (a click will close the color picker).
